LED Module、Button Module

Working Principle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - LED Module：LED（Light Emitting Diode）is a semiconductor device that converts electrical energy into light energy. Its working principle is based on the electron-hole recombination effect when a PN junction is forward-biased, resulting in light emission.
 - Button Module：Structurally, it is a mechanical contact switch. When pressed, the two contacts close, and the circuit is completed; when released, the contacts open, and the circuit is broken.
